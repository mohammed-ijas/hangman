        <ul>
          <li>The diagram is designed to look like a hanging man</li>
          <li>The word to guess is represented by a row of dashes, representing each letter of the word.</li>
          <li>Proper nouns, such as names, places, and brands, are not allowed. Slang words, sometimes referred to as
            informal or
            shortened words, are also not allowed.</li>
          <li>If the guessing player suggests a letter which occurs in the word,the other player writes it in all its
            correct positions.</li>
          <li>If the suggested letter does not occur in the word, the other
            player
            draws one element of a hanged man stick figure as a tally mark.</li>
          <li>The player guessing the word may, at any time, attempt to guess the whole word. If the word is correct,
            the game
            is
            over and the guesser wins.</li>
          <li> Otherwise, the other player may choose to penalize the guesser by adding an element to
            the diagram.</li>
          <li> If the other player makes enough incorrect guesses to allow his opponent to
            complete
            the diagram, the game is also over, this time with the guesser losing.</li>
          <li> The guesser can also win by
            guessing
            all the letters or numbers that appears in the word, thereby completing the word, before the diagram is
            completed.</li>
